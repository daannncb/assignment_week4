I used AI considerably less than previous assignments, and the actual process of troubleshooting felt much more satisfying. I'll ceratinly be using it much less frequently, but it is great for learning the name of the problem I need to google. When googling one of the problems before turning to AI, I saw an odd way to print the current date in a webpage that I've since lost (const today = new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0];).

I did use this webpage to get date like this: const date = new Date().toLocaleDateString();
