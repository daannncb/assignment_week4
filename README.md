REQUIREMENTS:
ðŸŽ¯ Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
ðŸŽ¯ Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either Responsive Design or media queries.
ðŸŽ¯ Create a working GET API route in your server.
ðŸŽ¯ Create a working POST API route in your client.
ðŸŽ¯ Seed your database with realistic-looking â€˜dummyâ€™ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.

I used AI considerably less than previous assignments, and the actual process of troubleshooting felt much more satisfying. I'll certainly be using it much less frequently, but it is great for learning the name of the problem I need to google. When googling one of the problems before turning to AI, I saw an odd way to print the current date in a webpage that I've since lost (const today = new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0];).

I did use this webpage to get date like this: const date = new Date().toLocaleDateString();

I've really phoned this in at the end, and figured the task was more around demonstrating a working server, SQL knowledge, GET and POST API routes. This was more a case of "better to submit something than nothing".

This may be less relevant to this assignment, but I'm treating this more as an exercise in thinking about my learning generally rather than building this app. Working in the group with Will and Gabby has been invaluable; I feel I've learnt so much from them both in terms of properly troubleshooting problems rather than googling endlessly til a snippet that fixes something appears. They've helped me properly read documentation, and shown me that it really is just lots and lots of exposure to syntax, time, and practice, and if I can learn from their examples, I'll be much better off in the future.
